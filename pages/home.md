Welcome to CASPER: *Computer Architecture for Security and Performance* group! 

Every wondered what components make a processor chip ? How do these components interact with each other ? How are the instructions fetched, decoded and executed by the processor ? What can be done to make the the processor execute them even more *faster* ? Why is the clock rate of most modern-day processors *stuck* at 2-4 Ghz ? Why do we need *caches* in the memory hierarchy ? Why worry about security when there are already hardware-level protection mechanisms like *paging* ? 

We are a group of people from [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in) department in [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in), who ponder about similar questions and whose research includes, but is not limited to, methologies to make the systems more robust against hardware-level attacks and to further improve the performance of modern-day processors, which also includes exploring and applying *Machine Learning* (ML) techniques!
